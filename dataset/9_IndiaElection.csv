"Far from perfect, seriously Indian elections are far better than even it's developed counterparts, look at the scale of the election.﻿ Respect for this country! 😍"
"India, the largest democracy of the world seeks to look after the benefits of its people. It has a long and detailed constitution with its underlying features. It has a detailed understanding of the rights of the citizens and proper procedure for the functioning of the democratic government."
"Seriously? I thought India has been using e-voting system for a decade. Anyway, It does make sense to complete the votes in 9 days due to such huge pool of casters. Must be a very hard time for the collectors, I wonder how many people were responsible for collecting such amount of votes."
I had been living in India for one year and I could tell that the sense of democracy is deeply spread in all every Indian people which truly make me happy. This country everyone has equal right and there is far more right that the citizen in India have than the right than I could imagine.

"Democracies are measured by the number of voters. India has the largest number. For me, India and the USA are good examples of how a democracy works. The democratic process in India covers a large population. It is going to be lot and lot of works to arrange the national election in India. Let’s give India government an applause."
"The world’s largest election — ever! I appreciate India government for pulling off Gargantuan election as the government effort to ensure that the votes of every one of its 900 million eligible voters, over 10 percent of the world’s population is counted, no matter how isolated! It’s sad that the recent India election required 12 million polling officials. It could be said that this was the largest democratic election in history."
