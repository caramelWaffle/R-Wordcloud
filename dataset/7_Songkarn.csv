Songkarn in Chiangmai is one of the best!! I really have to say Songkran is one of the most relaxing and enjoyable festival. Something magical about seeing so many people smile and have tons of fun.
"Absolutely incredible and not just because the epic water fights. There are so many beautiful rituals that has been around for over 1,380 YEARS! However, this festival has a clear purpose: reuniting the family and cleaning you for a fresh start in the New Year. It is very important for Thai people, and honestly, it is a lot of fun!"
"This is the festival that I have been last two summers ago and I could tell you all that the experience with this festival is priceless. During the festival period in Thailand, everything and everyone just became ten time more joyful with special energy and kindness. I couldn’t run around the city without seeing people smile, splashing water on others and wishing worlds."
"actually its comment to celebrate new year in many different way but its was so amazing to see they use water pistol to celebrate the new year, when i read about this issue i would like to have it in my own new year celebration it looks kind of cool tools with full of fun ."
"This is what I think the best way how to troll the new year that could make everyone enjoy pulse clame down from the heat of the summer. The essence of happiness could be found in every corner that we walk and everyone around us was truly blown by the excitement of the festival, I love this way of celebrate so much."
"Songkran festival in Thailand is fascinating. In fact, you can find the similar festival in many countries in Asia especially Southeast Asian nations: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar or even among the Dai people of China. Of course, the name of the festival differs depending on country but the festival duration takes place in the same month, April. I experienced this festival in both Thailand and Myanmar, and it was mind-blowing! What a must!"
"LoL. I have been there once and it was a really funny event indeed. Loads of foreigners, locals, span across all ages. I remember there were a guy who has that kind of big tank at his back while pumping a large stream of water from the gun, it was really cool!"
