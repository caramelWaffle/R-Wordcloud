"Ants are quite edible and are widely consumed all over the world. In Laos (Lao PDR), there is a salad which includes live ants and ants' eggs. They have a lime-lemony sour taste. In some tribal areas in India, like Bastar, they make a 'chutney' (dip) with ground ants. In some countries in South America, they sell chocolate covered ants. In fact, I've even seen an ant topping on a dessert in a Michlein star restaurant in France. (El Bulli was it? Not sure, so please don't flame me if the name of the restaurant is wrong). So some bold star restaurants do ants as well."
"Ants are edible and there are people that eat them as a delicacy not usually as primary source of food. But that may change in the near future, more specifically there are some people forecasting/predicting that insects will have to be a much greater source of protein by the year 2050 if global population increases at or near its current trend. Also, insects use less water and other resources pound for pound to provide protein. So don’t be too surprised to see more insect farms/ranches in the future… leg of cricket anyone?"
Ant egg is a good source of protein. It's verry popular in Thailand especially in the North. They can be cooked in many style but the most delicious should be omelet. It is so good idiet food because it has less fat and calories than chicken eggs.
"Actually i didn't try it but as i know ants contain formic acid. Ants, especially red ones, produce formic acid to sting predators, capture food and defend themselves. They have a poison gland in their abdomen that contracts and releases the acid. Formic acid, I’m told, is bitter. One Internet expert says the formic acid in ants makes them taste citrusy, like a lemon."
"I had tried eating this once in Chiang mai. they put these into omelette, it was super creamy in weirdly good way lol. but it was tasty actually."
"Wow, you're so brave to eat this 😀. It is something that's not easy to find even for the locals. It's somewhat expensive depends on season. In facts, it is widely eaten, especially, in North and Northeast of Thailand. It becomes part of Northeast's culture even. They have songs and dance performances just for the methods to get ant eggs from the trees. 😍"
I could not imagine how does the ant would test as a meal but I have eaten it accidentally several time and one thing I was sure of is that it's smell was not really good. But judging from the picture I could say that it might test like Thai papaya salad which I really love. So I think if I have a chance I might try it
