"From the list, I have visited four out of eight airports which are Beijing, Dubai, India and South Korea already in a couple of years ago and it seems that at the time that I have visited those airports, the crowd was not so much and the airport itself was not so packed at all. I think even though there are enormous amount of people visit those airport each year but with good management, their could manage to nicely welcome all the pasture anytime."
"How comes there is no Singapore's Changi Airport in the list? I thought Singapore was one of the world's top-5 destinations, especially in Southeast Asia. From the list it seems like Tokyo Haneda and Incheon are the only twos which are situated in Eastern Asia. Anyway, I have no wonder about Beijing and Hongkong."
" It is amazing how China works on developing its economic growth. Now, Beijing is about to open its second international airport this year, Beijing Daxing International Airport. Some say that this airport will become one of the biggest airport in the world! As Beijing's second international airport, Daxing Airport is expected to work with Beijing Capital International Airport to meet the capital's rising demand for air travel and help balance development in Beijing's southern and northern areas. Surely, this airport will bring many development to not just Beijing but China as a whole."
"Yeah! I am excited about Beijing Daxing International Airport too. I am currently living in Beijing. Hopefully, I will get a chance to fly from there. I do believe that the arrival of new airport in Beijing will be a major chance of development that push China to another level."
"I am surprised to see three of the list are China's airport. Not to mention about Hong Kong. The economic growth of China is untouchable. I personally believe that Beijing are inches closer to becoming world's busiest airport. And yes, it will be."
"yah its totally obvious , because China has the most crowdy people and population so its ok to have the most crowdy airport too"
