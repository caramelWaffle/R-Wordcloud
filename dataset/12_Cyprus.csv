"I haven’t had a chance to taste Cyprus wine yet nor that I have heard about it but with the reputation of the first wine inventor, I think there should be something that we could expect. what makes it even more interesting is that I though the first one who invent wine should be Greece or France."
"Last couple years ago I did a wine tour with my family in Cyprus. I can tell you this, Cyprus truly is a wine country. This island also has exceptionally stunning scenery. The locals here are very nice and welcoming. I suggest to come by during September, because Sep. is traditional month of the grape harvest from the vineyards covering the rolling slopes of Cyprus. A wine lover?, believe me, you will be blown away."
"Cyprus wine is a must. Local wine has its own unique flavour that you rarely found in commercial brands. Yes, Cyprus has amazing landscapes."
"Wow, I've never known about Cyprus have old story produce wine in the world. I've never tried Cyprus wine before. I will try later if I have a chance. I just would like to compare the taste of wine that I tried before"
"The rich history of Cyprus is accompanied by the grapevines. Winemaking in Cyprus has enjoyed historical continuity through a period of more than 5,000 years. Today, wine continues to play a role in the Cypriot identity. The country offers a panorama of wine history that puts it—not in the Old World or New World but—in the ‘Ancient World’ of wine."

"I just have known that Cyprus has such a contribution in the beverage history. This fact really surprise me since I never tried the wine from Cyprus not have heard about it before, does it just pop up and died in the history or does it just pass the brewery knowledge to other country."
