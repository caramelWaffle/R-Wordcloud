"The remarkable Malala! I read her book and it was extraordinarily inspiring. She was so brave and a very good role model. Sadly, in the modern world that we’re living in today, there are the vast numbers of minors around the world who can’t reach proper education especially girl just because of the social norm, male dominated culture, or whatsoever. We need more people like Malala in the world!"
"Having received the prize at the age of 17, Yousafzai is the youngest Nobel laureate. Yousafzai shared the prize with Kailash Satyarthi, a children's rights activist from India. She is the second Pakistani to receive a Nobel Prize after 1979 Physics laureate Abdus Salam."
"This Is the fact that could show the world that the female in Asia are capable of achieving the great thing as much as any man could, in this case she could accomplish this even earlier than most of the man could to."
"What a brave girl! She called upon her sisters around the world to be brave, to embrace the strength within themselves, & realise their full potential. Girls have equal right to access to the education as boys have. Malala did flight just for herself but for every girls. Even though it could bring her to death but she keeps flighting. Amazing Malala!"
"It can sometimes be easy to take the freedom to raise my voice, and especially the freedom to do so in safety, for granted. Malala reminds me that there are millions of girls and women without that luxury, and if we can do so must use our voices to make sure that that those who are silenced can be heard."
"Life lesson that I've learn from Malala is that If one man can destroy everything, why can’t one girl change it? All of us have the power to change our situation, our lives, our community and the world, no matter how difficult or impossible it may seem. She reminds us that women and girls have the strength and capability to do anything we set our minds to."
