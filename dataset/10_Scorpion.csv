"Scorpion! I just really want to taste it right now. It must feel very cool to eat a scorpions since everyone in the western country think that this animal is scary but while in the Asia you can eat what is considered the most dangerous animal we could imagine of. But, I also wonder whether the the venom will still be there after cooked or not since as we all know this animal can kill other animal within one hit."
"I didn't see people eating cooked scorpions until I went to Beijing... which is a bit unexpected. Traditional Chinese medicine values scorpions and scorpion parts for ability to treat skin conditions, cure infections and even prevent mosquito bites, and they're actually a pretty common street-side snack in parts of China."
"I could not stand just stare at it, while on the other part of the world could eat it on the sticks just like a hotdog. I think this is a good thing since if we could somehow manage to capture the Scorpion and then export it to the country in Asia, I think there would be less population of the Scorpion in our area hence safer environment and they can also enjoy the scorpion too."
That's okay. I just had Mcdonalds yesterday and studies have proven it to be more dangerous than scorpions.﻿🧐
" In Thailand we do not eat only scorpion but we also eat many kind of insects such as bamboo worm, cricket, and grass hopper. It’s very easy to find on market and food street. The price is very cheap around 20 bath. People usually add salt and soy sauce on them."
Fried insects can be a very good snack and it is addictive. 😁
" tried eating one in Wangfujing street, Beijing. It was quite expensive, 30 RMB ($4.36) for a big scorpion. The taste was unique, not in a good way, to be honest. It was hard to tell if it is actually a ‘normal food’ or a ‘exotic food’ in the big city like Beijing. But once in a lifetime, why not right?"
"The venom of most scorpions is only potent enough to kill the small insects or animals that they feed on. In fact, the United States has only one type of scorpion that is considered deadly to humans."
