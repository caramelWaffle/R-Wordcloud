I am not surprise why Thailand is poor English skill. May be because standard of each school (I mean Private school and Government school). Thailand have a big wealth gap between each rich people and poor people. This is a reason why people from Thailand suffer from poverty
"Just for more fun fact, in 2018, Singapore was actually ranked #3 in the global ranking and ranked #1 among Asian countries. In 2000, Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong launched the Speak Good English Movement. This campaign encourages Singaporeans to speak and write using Standard English rather than the local Singlish dialect. Well done Singapore !"
"As I am also not an English mother tongue speaker like others, I can say that I truly understand the struggle of the people who are not grown up in the English speaking countries. Even we study so hard but there is no one there for us to practice speaking with, so it makes everything even harder for us to improve, not only speaking but listening too. this is the opposite for the countries that have more education support like Singapore or Japan."
"actually its not right, you may also know about afghanistan , they are so cool as you can see some of them talk as native speaker , so puting them on the last line of the list is not fair"
"This result is really useful for further study for the factors that affect the English skill of each particular country. The two major things I could see now is that the history of the colonisation by the united kingdom or the united state of America like Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and India which are the country that top the rank. Or the other factor maybe the economic status of the country like South Korea, China and Japan are also perform very well in the chart."
"I was not surprised with this ranking, especially where Thailand was in this ranking. Thailand is one of the country that never been colonised before while its neighbour country, take for example Vietnam, once was colonised by French. Malaysia, India, Hong Kong, Singapore and Pakistan were once colonised by United Kingdom. These Asian countries that had been colonised by United Kingdom are at the better ranking. However, the major factor of English communication problems among Thais is from poor English education system; which clearly, it needs to be reformed."
