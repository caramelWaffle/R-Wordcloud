"Wow! Great work finding out this information, I didn’t know that before and it’s a really long name for Thailand! Plus, the meaning of the name is beautifully composed. Bangkok is a very fantastic city to explore. It is a great combination of the civilisation and culture. Street foods sold there are amazing and cheap. I love Bangkok."
"Here is roughly what it means in English: The city of angels, the great city, the residence of the Emerald Buddha, the impregnable city (of Ayutthaya) of God Indra, the grand capital of the world endowed with nine precious gems, the happy city, abounding in an enormous Royal Palace that resembles the heavenly abode where reigns the reincarnated god, a city given by Indra and built by Vishnukarn."
"The full name is composed of about 40 words,It's some kind of poetry which so beautiful and elaborate.I don't really know how to explain For example ,""Krung thep mahanakhon,Amon Rattanakosin...."" krung thep mahanakhon means - city of angels Amor Rattanakosin meana - glorious rattakosin(Kingdom of Thailand) As you can see ,the pronunciation of each last word is similar"
"I think it is the longest name I have heard in my life. It even has the song that fully contains the full name of Bangkok, just imagine that anything that has to have a song to make the people remember the name easily is just totally cool, but hopefully the next time I'm visiting the beautiful city of Bangkok, Thailand it full name won't be print on my boarding part cuz if it is, they're gonna need much bigger bidding part for sure ."
"that looks so weird, so i don't have any idea the one who did first what was the purpose to make it so long , but what i think it in past it was a kind of if you want to be more proud of your country you make some complex name or make someting totally uniqe which every one could remember it"
"wow, amazing Thailand. I am Thai but I can't remember full name of Bangkok"
"After two decades of living in the Kingdom of Thailand, I swear to god, I have never heard anyone calling nor referring to her as such wall of text. The most common ones are Thai, Muang Thai, and Thailand. Also not a single person calling her as Kingdom of Thailand as well. This may well, legally, be her official name, but surely hard to hear it using in daily life."
